<!--
    I was able to accomplish my task by using @media screen and () in my css files.
    I had maximums and minimums set for both the height and the width.
    This made it so that whenever the website was altered to below 600px for both the height and the width, he background would turn yellow.
    If both the background and height are greater than 600px, then the background would become cyan.
